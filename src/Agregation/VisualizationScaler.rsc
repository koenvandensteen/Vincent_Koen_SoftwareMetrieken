module Agregation::VisualizationScaler

//todo: implement a method that returns a colour (rgb) for each entry in a map based on their relative ranking

// implement two visualizations
// 1 - relative: rank all items from best to worst (and colour accordingly)
// 2 - absolute: rank based on risk categories 1 = red, 5 = green


// other ideas
// - checkbox for include test code or not
// - checkbox greyscale (for printing)
